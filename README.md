## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

This project demonstrates proficiency in data modeling and visualization within the Looker Studio environment.

*   **Data Source:** Google Search Console Connector.
*   **Data Blending:**
    *   A left join was performed on the GSC "URL Impression" (pages) and "Site Impression" (keywords) tables.
    *   **Join Key:** A custom key was created by concatenating `Landing Page` and `Date` to ensure accurate mapping between pages and the keywords driving their impressions.
*   **Custom Dimensions & Logic:**
    *   **Keyword Type (Brand vs. Generic):** A `CASE` statement was implemented to classify keywords based on a predefined list of brand terms.
        ```sql
        -- Example Logic
        CASE
          WHEN REGEXP_MATCH(Query, '(?i)(your-brand-keyword-1|your-brand-keyword-2)') THEN 'Branded'
          ELSE 'Generic'
        END
        ```
    *   **Keyword Length (Short vs. Long Tail):** A `CASE` statement using `REGEXP_REPLACE` to count the number of words in a query.
        ```sql
        -- Example Logic
        CASE
          WHEN LENGTH(REGEXP_REPLACE(Query, r'[^ ]', '')) + 1 <= 2 THEN 'Short Tail (1-2 words)'
          ELSE 'Long Tail (3+ words)'
        END
        ```
    *   **SERP Page Buckets:** `CASE` statements were used to group keywords by their average position into Top 3, Top 10, Top 20, and other ranking buckets.
*   **Calculated Metrics:** Created custom fields for month-over-month (MoM) comparisons for all key metrics to track growth and identify trends.
